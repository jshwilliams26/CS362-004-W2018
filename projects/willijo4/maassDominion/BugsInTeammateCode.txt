	I found a bug for the smithy card with my cardtest2 and randomtestcard1 programs.  
For the cardtest2 program, it initializes the game with 2, 3, and 4 players, and then 
it returns whether the number of cards in each player's hand is 5 before smithy and 7 
after (since smithy draws 3 cards to the hand and then discards 1 from the hand).  
It returns True each time for 5 cards in the hand before playing smithy and False for 
7 cards in the hand after playing smithy.  The randomtestcard1 tests the smithy card 
by playing the smithy card 100,000 times each with a random number of players from 1 
to 5.  For a correct number of players (2-4 players), the number of cards in hand after 
playing smithy should be two more than before playing smithy.  For every random test 
with a valid number of players, the number of cards in hand changed to an incorrect 
number every single time after the smithy card was played.  If I look at the playSmithy 
function in the maass dominion.c code, the for loop looks like "for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)", 
so it draws a card into the player's hand 4 times instead of 3, which is why the number 
of cards in hand for a player after playing smithy is not correct.
	For the adventurer card, when I ran cardtest1, it runs adventurer for 2 players 
for when there are 0, 1, and 2 treasure cards in each player's hand.  There is a 
bug that was found - when there are no treasure cards in the players' hands, the 
first player has a negative number of cards in hand (-592) after playing adventurer:

This could be because of an error that Sarah Maas introduced into the playAdventurer 
function.  The maass adventurer function (playAdventurer), has 2 instances of 
"state->handCount[currentPlayer]--;" in the code when the original code only has this 
line once.  This could be why the number of cards in the first player's hand after 
playing the adventurer card is less than 0.
